# Gocopy, the cp command rewritten with go!

This was an exercise in my go learning journey, **This is not intended for personal use since it's really basic!!**

I used [urfave/cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli) library to create this program, it misses the following functionality:

- Recursive copy of directories
- Multiple arguments

Am not intending to expand the functionality of this program since it was only an exercise, but if you want to expand it for yourself go for it!
